# OBSOLETE NCrystal plugin template

With the release of NCrystal 4.0.0, this repository no longer serves as a template for NCrystal plugins. Please refer to the instructions at the [PluginsDevelopment](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/wiki/PluginsDevelopment) page in the NCrystal wiki for information about the new procedures.

Feel free to [reach out](https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal/issues) if you need help migrating a plugin to NCrystal 4.
